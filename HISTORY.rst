0.9.3 (2020-12-15)
------------------

* Fixed incorrect handling of classification map nodata value in SpectralHomogenizer (default is now -9999).
* Updated minimal version of specclassify to 0.2.8. This fixes issue #8 (Homogenization using kNN classifiers uses
  faulty weights in case SpectralHomogenizer.predict_by_machine_learner() is called with global_clf_threshold=None.).
* Changed minimum and maximum values used for normalization of spectral distance measures. SAM values are now
  normalized between 0 and 15 degrees SA and all other measures use the 90% percentile as maximum value.
  This fixes issue #9 (Harmonization weights are affected by extreme values in the computed spectral distances between
  spectrum and available regressors.).


0.9.2 (2020-12-15)
------------------

* Cluster classifiers can now be saved as JSON files (relates to issue #5).
* Added attributes 'spechomo_version' and 'spechomo_versionalias' to ClusterLearner.


0.9.1 (2020-12-11)
------------------

* Added URL checker and corresponding CI job.
* Removed travis related files.
* Replaced hard-coded links in documentation by cross-linking directives.


0.9.0 (2020-11-02)
------------------

* Replaced deprecated 'source activate' by 'conda activate.'
* Updated installation instructions.
* Revised requirements.
* Added doc, test, lint and dev requirements to optional requirements in setup.py.
* Updated LR and QR classifiers.
* Added sklearn import to avoid static TLS ImportError.
* Improved code style of SpectralHomogenizer.interpolate_cube() and SpectralHomogenizer.predict().
* Bugfix for also predicting spectral information for pixels that contain nodata in any band
  (causes faulty predictions).
* Bugfix for only choosing 25 spectra in classifier creation in case the maximum angle threshold is automatically
  set to 0 because there are many well matching spectra.
* Added minimal version of geoarray.


0.8.2 (2020-10-12)
------------------

* Use SPDX license identifier and set all files to GLP3+ to be consistent with license headers in the source files.


0.8.1 (2020-10-08)
------------------

* Added latest QR classifiers.


0.8.0 (2020-10-07)

  at the first run (added corresponding code).
* Fixed TemporaryDirectory bug in Test_Utils.test_export_classifiers_as_JSON().
* Re-enabled CI job 'deploy_pypi'.


0.6.10 (2020-09-25)
-------------------

* Fixed an AssertionError within ClusterClassifier_Generator.create_classifiers() caused by nodata pixels in the target
  sensor reference cube that were not dropped before creating the classifier.


0.6.9 (2020-09-25)
------------------

* Moved matplotlib imports function/class level to avoid static TLS ImportError.


0.6.8 (2020-09-25)
------------------

* Moved scipy imports function/class level to avoid static TLS ImportError.
* environment_spechomo.yml now uses Python 3.7+.
* scikit-learn is now pinned to 0.23.2+ due to classifier recreation.


0.6.7 (2020-09-24)
------------------

* Fixed a DeprecationWarning in case of scikit-learn>=0.23.
* Dumped regressors now use the second highest dill protocol in order to have some downwards compatibility.


0.6.6 (2020-09-24)
------------------

* Moved imports of scikit-learn to function/class level to avoid static TLS ImportError.


0.6.5 (2020-09-15)
------------------

  programming environments.
* The documentation now contains links to the published version of the research paper corresponding to SpecHomo.
* Changed Zenodo title and description.
* Fixed fallback algorithm in SpectralHomogenizer.predict_by_machine_learner() and added corresponding tests.
* SpectralHomogenizer.interpolate_cube() now returns a GeoArray instead of a numpy array.


0.5.0 (2020-02-20)
